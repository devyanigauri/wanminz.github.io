      <p class="about">
        <span>
         How can you help? Older adults are the only natural resource that is increasing on our planet. Older Americans take global warming 14 percent less seriously than millennials. But your contribution appears undervalued. 
		  
	You can do more to help preserve the planet.
        </span>

        <h3>Speak Up!</h3>

		 <p>Talk to your friends and family, and make sure your representatives are making good decisions. That is the single biggest way you can make an impact on global climate change. Also you can send a message that you care about the warming world. Encourage Congress to enact new laws that limit carbon emissions and require polluters to pay for the emissions they produce. You can help protect public lands, stop offshore drilling, and more. </p>
        
          <p>As grandparents, especially grandparents who take a stand for the health of the planet, you have a unique opportunity to help teach your grandchildren about climate change. </p>
		  
		 <p> You can take action on climate change by the choices that  you make and by being a role model for climate action. </p>
			
		 <p> Your actions show in the books buy for and/or read to your grandchildren, the videos and websites you share with them and the ways we include them in the climate conversation.</p>

		  You have the ability to not only show your grandchildren the wonders of the world, but to also  instill in them a respect for how you should treat the earth.</p>

		  <p>Change only happens when individual take action.</p>

      <h2>Here's how you can start your actions from your home</h2>
     
	 <section>
	  
	  <h3> Reduce your carbon footprint. </h3>
	  
    <li> Your carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide released into the air because of your own energy needs. You need transportation, electricity, food, clothing, and other goods. Your choices can make a difference. </li>
	   
	<li>Swap old incandescent light bulbs for the new compact fluorescent lights (CFLs). They use only 25% as much electricity to give the same light. They last ten times longer.</li>

	<li>Turn off lights, TVs, computers, when you do not need them. Unplug! Any electronic gadget you can turn on with a remote (TV, DVD player ) uses power even when it is "off." </li>
	
	<li>Appliances with a digital clock (like a coffee maker) or a power adapter (like a laptop computer) also suck power like a sneaky vampire. Plug these kinds of things into a surge protector or power strip that has an on/off switch. Then you can shut off all the power without unplugging each gadget.</li>
	
	<li>There are even power strips that glow to show you how much power is going through them, and power strips you can control from your computer or mobile phone.</li>
	
	<li>Turn up the thermostat on the air conditioning when it's hot. Use fans if you're still hot. They use much less power.</li>
	
	<li>Turn down the thermostat on the heating when it's cold. Sweaters, blankets, and socks are good for you and better for the planet.</li>
	
	<li>Walk or ride your bike instead of taking a car everywhere. Even a 2-mile car trip puts 2 pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere! If you must ride, carpool.</li>

      <h3> Reduce your trash pile. </h3>
	  
     <li>Recycle everything you can. If your city does not pick up recycled materials, find out who you can talk to about starting this service. You should be recycling paper, aluminum cans, cardboard, food cans, plastic, glass, newspapers, magazines, junk mail, phone books, and anything else made of paper.</li>
	
	<li>Use fewer containers. Buy the product that uses less packaging material. Even if you recycle packaging materials, it takes energy to create them in the first place and energy to remake them into something else.</li>
 
	<li>Recycle old appliances. Recycling an old refrigerator through the EPAâ€™s Responsible Appliance Disposal Program can prevent an additional 10,000 pounds of carbon pollution because the global-warming pollutants in the refrigerants and foam would be properly captured rather than vented to the air.</li>

	<li>Some utilities offer financial incentives for recycling old appliances or buying new, energy-efficient models. Consumers can search for incentives online or call their utility. The Energy Star site has information on rebates.</li>
