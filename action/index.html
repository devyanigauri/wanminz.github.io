        In terms of issue (3) (what seniors can do), we want them to take personal
        action since that will mean they are more likely to think about, discuss,
        and vote based on this issue. Come up with three senior-appropriate activities
        that they can do and provide links to resources. The City of Chicago has
        a website with suggestions:http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/what_you_can_do___make_a_difference/6.php
        On yourwebsite, give them step-by-step instructions for how to get started
        with links toappropriate city/regional websites. Many of the people at these
        talks will be elderly and have physical limitations, so anticipate any risks
        and provide cautionary statements as appropriate to make sure they do these
        activities safely! Remember, we want them to vote on this issue, so for the
        third activity, link to a website that tells them who their representatives
        are and how to register to vote in Illinois.
