      <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <p class="about">
        <span>
          We are EARTH4THEM. A nonprofit organization aimed to help senior citizens
          take charge of their grandchildren's futures! Climate change is a very
          real issue that will eventually end up affecting the future generations
          if we don't take action now.
        </span>
        <span>
          We noticed that the majority of the voters are an older generation.
          Therefore, you have a sayâ€”a voice in this cause. You will be the reason
          why your grandchildren will still be able to see polar bears and enjoy
          their summers without extreme heatwaves.
        </span>
        <span>
          Children are the future. They will be the ones at the expense of climate
          change and we should not stand by and let that happen.
          "But how do I start taking action?", you ask.
          Well, that's what EARTH4THEM is here for!
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>What Do We Do?</h2>
      <p>
        EARTH4THEM's mission is to offer many resources to senior citizens for
        taking part in making our Earth a better place. We provide you plenty of
        ways that you can take action and encourage you along the way. Just because
        you're a grandparent doesn't mean you can't participate in protecting your
        grandchildren's futures!
