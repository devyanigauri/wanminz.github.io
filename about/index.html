      <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
      <p class="about">
        <span>
          We are EARTH4THEM. A nonprofit organization aimed to help senior citizens
          take charge of their grandchildren's futures! Climate change is a very
          real issue that will eventually end up affecting the future generations
          if we don't take action now.
        </span>
        <span>
          We noticed that the majority of the voters are an older generation. [5]
          Therefore, you have a sayâ€”a voice in this cause. You will be the reason
          why your grandchildren will still be able to see polar bears and enjoy
          their summers without extreme heatwaves.
        </span>
        <span>
          Children are the future. They will be the ones at the expense of climate
          change and we should not stand by and let that happen.
          "But how do I start taking action?", you ask.
          Well, that's what EARTH4THEM is here for!
        </span>
      </p>
      <h2>What Do We Do?</h2>
      <p>
        EARTH4THEM's mission is to offer many resources to senior citizens for
        taking part in making our Earth a better place. We provide you plenty of
        ways that you can take action and encourage you along the way. Just because
        you're a grandparent doesn't mean you can't participate in protecting your
        grandchildren's futures!

      <h2>What Does Climate Change Have Anything to Do with You?</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Severe Weather</h3>
        <ol class="effects">
          <li>Sudden and severe weather changes can leave you unprepared for
            them [1]</li>
          <li>Nursing homes are in hurricane-areas and immediate evacuation would
            be tough [3]</li>
          <li>Odd weather patterns and frequent wildfires increases the amount of
            pollen, dust, and smoke in the air [6]</li>
          </li>
          <li>The elderly tend to fall victim to weather events like hurricanes
            and floods [7]</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Reduced Air Quality</h3>
        <ol class="effects">
          <li>If you are already suffering from heart or lung disease, the air
            pollution (like smog) will only make it worse [3]</li>
          <li>Because of the warming tempatures, ground-level ozones will form
            and increase seasonal allergies [6]</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Spreading of Illnesses</h3>
        <ol class="effects">
          <li>Elderly are more sensitive to environmental changes and exposures
            to toxins and illnesses [4]</li>
          <li>Warmer temperatures will breed more ticks and mosquitos who carry
            diseases that can be easily spread, especially those with weak immune
            systems</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Extreme Heat</h3>
        <ol class="effects">
          <li>Your central nervous system is sensitive to high internal temperatures
            causing memory loss, confusion, and delirium. Because it is hot, your
            heart has to work harder, which increases the risk for myocardial
            infraction [4]</li>
          <li>Senior citizens are the most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses
            like malaria and malnutrition [2]</li>
          <li>The heat exposure can increase the risk of illness particularly
            those with diabetes, congestive heart failure, or any other chronic
            health conditions as sensitivity to heat goes up [6]</li>
