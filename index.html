      <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Weather</em> is the state of the atmosphere—its temperature, humidity,
        wind, rainfall and so on—over hours to weeks. It is influenced by the oceans,
        land surfaces and ice sheets, which together with the atmosphere form what
        is called the ‘climate system’.
        <br>
        <em>Climate,</em> in its broadest sense, is the statistical description
        of the state of the climate system.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Climate change</strong> is a change in the pattern of weather,
        and related changes in oceans, land surfaces and ice sheets,
        occurring over time scales of decades or longer. It is a change in the
        statistical properties of the climate system that persists for several
        decades or longer—usually at least 30 years. These statistical properties
        include averages, variability and extremes. Climate change may be due
        to natural processes, such as changes in the Sun’s radiation, volcanoes
        or internal variability in the climate system, or due to human influences
        such as changes in the composition of the atmosphere or land use.[1]
      </p>
      <h2>Is Earth's Climate Changing?</h2>
      <p>
        Earth's climate is always changing. There have been times when Earth's
        climate has been warmer than it is now. There have been times when it has
        been cooler. These times can last thousands or millions of years. People
        who study Earth see that Earth's climate is getting warmer. Earth's temperature
        has gone up about one degree Fahrenheit in the last 100 years. This may
        not seem like much. But small changes in Earth's temperature can have big
        effects. Some effects are already happening. Warming of Earth's climate
        has caused some snow and ice to melt. The warming also has caused oceans
        to rise. And it has changed the timing of when certain plants grow.[2]
      </p>
      <h2>What are the causes of climate change?</h2>
      <p>
        The primary cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels, such
        as oil and coal, which emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere—primarily
        carbon dioxide. Other human activities, such as agriculture and deforestation,
        also contribute to the proliferation of greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
        <br>
        While some quantities of these gases are a naturally occurring and critical
        part of Earth’s temperature control system, the atmospheric concentration
        of CO2 did not rise above 300 parts per million between the advent of human
        civilization roughly 10,000 years ago and 1900. Today it is at about 400 ppm,
        a level not reached in more than 400,000 years.[3]
      </p>
      <h2>How will Climate Change affect us in the future?</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change is already making a huge impact on our lives, whether we
        notice it or not. In the future, however, it is going to become a lot more
        noticeable. A recent international study in the Lancet says that many more
        people will be exposed to extreme weather events over the next century than
        previously thought—“a potentially catastrophic risk to human health” that
        could undo 50 years of global health gains.
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Power outages in extreme weather could cripple hospitals and transportation
            systems when we need them most.</li>
          <li>Crop declines could lead to undernutrition, hunger, and higher food
            prices. More CO2 in the air could make staple crops like barley and
            soy less nutritious.</li>
          <li>Occupational hazards such as risk of heatstroke will rise, especially
            among farmers and construction workers. Labor could shift to dawn and
            dusk, times when more disease-­carrying insects are out.</li>
          <li>Hotter days, more rain, and higher humidity will produce more ticks,
            which spread infectious diseases like Lyme disease. Ticks could be in
            much of the eastern U.S. by 2080.</li>
          <li>Trauma from floods, droughts, and heat waves can lead to mental health
            issues like anxiety, depression, and suicide.</li>
          <li>More heat can mean longer allergy seasons and more respiratory disease.
            More rain increases mold, fungi, and indoor air pollutants.</li>
          <li>Mosquito-borne dengue fever has increased 30-fold in the past 50 years.
            Three-quarters of those exposed so far live in the Asia-Pacific region.</li>
          <li>Senior citizens and poor children—especially those already afflicted
            with malaria, malnutrition, and diarrhea—tend to be most vulnerable to
            heat-related illnesses.</li>
          <li>Drought and chronic water shortages harm rural areas and 150 million
            city dwellers. If localities don’t adjust quickly, that number could
            be nearly a billion by 2050.</li>
          <li>Rising sea levels can threaten freshwater supplies for people living
            in low-lying areas. More severe storms can cause city sewage systems to overflow.</li>
